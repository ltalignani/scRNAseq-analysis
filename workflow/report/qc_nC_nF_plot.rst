**nCount vs. nFeatures Plot**
Plotting nCount (total UMI count per cell) against nFeatures (number of detected genes per cell) is a crucial quality control step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. This visualization helps to assess the quality of individual cells and identify potential issues.
